# Oblig1

In oblig 1, you will be introduced to Python and learn the fundamentals. It consists of 4 introductory exercises and one mandatory submission. You will find the introductory exercises in the following scripts:
1. `01_python_introduction.ipynb`
2. `02_python_script.py`
3. `03_numpy.py`
4. `04_pyglet_introduction.py`

The submission is the script `assignment.py`. You may notice that some of the files have the `.py` extension, while others have `.ipynb` extension. The `.ipynb` files are interactive can be opened in a Jupyter Notebook, while the `.py` are not and should be executed as one singular script.

You will furthermore find the files `.python-version` and `requirements.txt`. They are described in https://asiangoldfish.github.io/bma1020-python-intro/, but in short they describe the required Python version and dependencies respectively.

Good luck!
