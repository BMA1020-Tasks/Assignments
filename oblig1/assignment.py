"""
This is the assignment submission for oblig 1. You will use some of what you
have learned from the introduction to Python, Numpy and Pyglet to solve the
assignment.

Task:
    - Create a 2D simulation of a ball that bounces on the window borders.
Specifications:
    - The balls have random initial velocity between 30 and 70 pixels per
      seconds in any direction 2D space.
    - The window size should be 1280x720.
    - To check whether the ball collides with the border, compute the distance
      between the ball and the window border using the ball's radius.
    - The ball's radius is a random value between 25 and 100 radius in pixels.
    - The ball spawns at a random location on the screen. Make sure it does not
      clip with the window border.
